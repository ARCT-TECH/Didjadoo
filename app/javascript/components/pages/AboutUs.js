            I would consider myself a "nerd", when it comes to puzzles. You
            could say, this trait helps me when it comes to problem solving and
            trouble shooting. My Teammates found me during our endeavor at LEARN
            Academy. We Hope you enjoy This App as much as we enjoyed creating
            it!

            I am a Junior Full Stack Web Developer. Prior to getting into tech,
            I was a Personnel Specialist in the United States Navy for 10 years.
            While on Active Duty, I was stationed and traveled all around the
            world. I have a Bachelors of Science in Criminal Justice, and a
            Masters in Business Administration. I decided to pivot into tech.
            With using the skills I acquired in the military, it has made my
            transition easy. I enjoy brainstorming and mapping out new
            application design and technologies for issues that have once
            inconvenienced me and others.

          <h3>Tabi</h3>
          <p className="bios">
            Prior to full stack development, I served in the United States
            Marine Corps as a Cyber Intelligence Analyst. However, after much
            soul searching, I made a career jump to Software Development.
            Software development offers me an opportunity to chase my passions
            of problem solving, directly impacting mission, and connecting with
            people to provide them with the exact product they require or want.
            I am passionate about watching a multiple-page application come to
            fruition via both front-end and back-end development. Hardened
            network security is important to me, thus, I take pride in code
            validations to ensure only certain items and values are permitted. I
            enjoy the organization and the ability to quickly parse through big
            data with relational databases, like PostgreSQL. Aside from program
            functionality, I am enjoy crafting live pages with HTML and CSS!
