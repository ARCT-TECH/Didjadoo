      Anthony: I would consider myself a "nerd", when it comes to puzzles. You could say, this trait helps me when it comes to problem solving and trouble shooting. My Teammates found me during our endeavor at LEARN Academy. We Hope you enjoy This App as much as we enjoyed creating it!

      Ciani: Hello, I am Ciani Brown, a Junior Full Stack Web Developer. Prior to getting into tech, I was a Personnel Specialist in the United States Navy for 10 years. While on Active Duty, I was stationed and traveled all around the world. I have a Bachelors of Science in Criminal Justice, and a Masters in Business Administration.
I decided to pivot into tech. With using the skills I acquired in the military, it has made my transition easy.
I enjoy brainstorming and mapping out new application design and technologies for issues that have once inconvenienced me and others.
